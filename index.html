    <h2>Proposition: The occurence of substantiated claims against law enforcement

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					The figure above shows a compilation of 5 stacked bar charts 
					that represent a timeline of how the proportion of board disposition 
					types have changed over time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[-1] I chose to aggregate Native Americans with Other, Null, and Refused. This was
					because they did not fit my intended trend of showing proportion growth over time - 
					the lower number of complaints made the trend much fuzzier, so I chose to aggregate 
					(and therefore erase) their experiences altogether
				</li>
				<li>
					[-2] I do not mention that this data includes repeat offendors and incidents that have multiple 
					complaints and dispositions attatched to them. This was because filtering down repeat offendors
					and choosing a single bord disposition result per incident made the "growing" trend I wanted to show
					across all races much less clear. I think that letting the reader assume that there is only one complaint 
					assosciated with each incident makes this chart more persuasive.
				</li>
				<li>
					[1] I chose to aggregate all substantiated claims and color them red. At the same time, I 
					colored exonerated and unsubstantiated claims in shades of gray. I mainly did this 
					to draw attention to the group of substantiated claims that were at the bottom of the 
					diagram to make reading their trends easier.
				</li>
				<li>
					[-1] I only chose the subset of years that made this increasing trend the clearest.
					Including data from before 2007 could actually let me argue a very different proposition (each race's 
					substantiated proportions were shaped like a U).
					So, I think keeping 2007-2020 created a more persuasive graphic.
				</li>
				<li>
					[1.5] I added arrows and annotations to draw attention to the trends I wanted the 
					viewer to perceive. I believe this made my visualization easier to follow, and therefore more 
					persuasive. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="./index_files/1.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
          The figure above shows the number of complaints that were substantiated 
		  for each race over time, starting from 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[-1] I chose to aggregate Native Americans with Other, Null, and Refused, because they did not 
					fit my intended trend. Including them would have actually shown a stark increase in the 
					number of substantiated complaints, so I aggregated it with other categories that trended downwards.
					While this made my visualization more persuasive, it also erases Native American identities, which already
					happens far too often
				</li>
				<li>
					[-0.5] I chose to show the group of substantiated complaints by itself and in raw
					counts. This was done without comparing the substantiated number to the total number of complaints.
					While I feel that this led to an easier-to-read graphic, it hides that the these drops may be because
					the total number of claims 
					has decreased since 2015 as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					[-1] I added in annotations to draw attention to the section of the graph that I wanted to (the right side).
					Additionally, I draw a completely horizontal line for the Asian line, even though the value 
					actually increases between 2015 and 2019, because it does not persuade against the proposition
				</li>
				<li>
					[-1] I chose not to filter for or exclude repeat offendors and claims that have multiple allegations tied to it.
					This was just because preserving these arguable duplicates made the decline of substantiated complaints more drastic.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>


	  	After documenting these decisions, write a 2–3 paragraph
	   final reflection on your overall design process 
	   across both visualizations. What was straightforward or difficult? 
	   What surprised you? How do you now define “ethical analysis and visualization”? 
	   What bounds (if any) can you draw to distinguish “acceptable” persuasive choices 
	   vs. “misleading” ones (and if none, why not)?
