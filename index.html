    <h2>Proposition: The occurence of substantiated claims against law enforcement

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

					The figure above shows a compilation of 5 stacked bar charts 
					that represent a timeline of how the proportion of board disposition 
					types have changed over time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[-1] I chose to aggregate Native Americans with Other, Null, and Refused. This was
					because they did not fit my intended trend of showing proportion growth over time - 
					the lower number of complaints made the trend much fuzzier, so I chose to aggregate 
					(and therefore erase) their experiences altogether
				</li>
				<li>
					[-2] I do not mention that this data includes repeat offendors and incidents that have multiple 
					complaints and dispositions attatched to them. This was because filtering down repeat offendors
					and choosing a single bord disposition result per incident made the "growing" trend I wanted to show
					across all races much less clear. I think that letting the reader assume that there is only one complaint 
					assosciated with each incident makes this chart more persuasive.
				</li>
				<li>
					[1] I chose to aggregate all substantiated claims and color them red. At the same time, I 
					colored exonerated and unsubstantiated claims in shades of gray. I mainly did this 
					to draw attention to the group of substantiated claims that were at the bottom of the 
					diagram to make reading their trends easier.
				</li>
				<li>
					[-1] I only chose the subset of years that made this increasing trend the clearest.
					Including data from before 2007 could actually let me argue a very different proposition (each race's 
					substantiated proportions were shaped like a U).
					So, I think keeping 2007-2020 created a more persuasive graphic.
				</li>
				<li>
					[1.5] I added arrows and annotations to draw attention to the trends I wanted the 
					viewer to perceive. I believe this made my visualization easier to follow, and therefore more 
					persuasive. 
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="./index_files/1.png" alt="">
				<figcaption>
          The figure above shows the number of complaints that were substantiated 
		  for each race over time, starting from 2000.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>[-1] I chose to aggregate Native Americans with Other, Null, and Refused, because they did not 
					fit my intended trend. Including them would have actually shown a stark increase in the 
					number of substantiated complaints, so I aggregated it with other categories that trended downwards.
					While this made my visualization more persuasive, it also erases Native American identities, which already
					happens far too often
				</li>
				<li>
					[-0.5] I chose to show the group of substantiated complaints by itself and in raw
					counts. This was done without comparing the substantiated number to the total number of complaints.
					While I feel that this led to an easier-to-read graphic, it hides that the these drops may be because
					the total number of claims 
					has decreased since 2015 as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					[-1] I added in annotations to draw attention to the section of the graph that I wanted to (the right side).
					Additionally, I draw a completely horizontal line for the Asian line, even though the value 
					actually increases between 2015 and 2019, because it does not persuade against the proposition
				</li>
				<li>
					[-1] I chose not to filter for or exclude repeat offendors and claims that have multiple allegations tied to it.
					This was just because preserving these arguable duplicates made the decline of substantiated complaints more drastic.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

	  <p>
		Similar to my process for A2, I felt like I had a very difficult time with this assignment. 
		The concept of making conflicting visualizations felt like an insurmountable task at first. 
		So, I tried to approach this problem methodically. Since I didn't have a very good understanding of 
		the dataset at first,
		I began with a few days of hacking away and making simple and unfiltered exploratory visualizations 
		such as line charts and bar charts. After about three days and several tableau tutorials videos, 
		I finally figured out how to make category groupings and stacked bar graphs for my dataset. I think this moment was
		a turning point in my exploration. With this type of visualization, I was able to
		discern correlations between my calculated measures and dimensions much more clearly!
	  </p>
	  <p>
		At this point, I decided to just make my broad proposition that "substantiated claim occurence 
		has increased for all races" and simply do whatever it took to output charts 
		that proved and disproved it. Thanks to my familiarity with the dataset, 
		once I got into this mindset, I churned out the above two visualizations 
		in less than an hour. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I also mention this in my design rationale, but I believe that both of my visualizations are pretty deceptive. 
		I intentionally included, 
		grouped, transformed, and excluded data to suit my whims, and felt very devious during this process. 
		Though I was skeptical of my ability to complete this assignment at
		first, I managed "chisel" the "rock" of my data into the "statue" of a visualization
		that proved exactly what I wanted to. This made me realize firsthand the scary idea that
		visualizing data with strong preconceived biases may cause us to try and prove ourselves right rather than
		exploring the data on its own and trying to organically find its trends. I believe that there should be 
		strict documentation practices on how visualizations are created and the positionalities of its creators
		in order to control for the biases we 
		naturally have when approaching data. 
		I am a strong believer in impact over intent, and 
		each design decision made in a visualization, regardless of intent, has an impact on the viewer. 
		While decisions can accentuate correlations 
		that definitely exist in the data, they may also obfuscate information from viewers.
		Without this documentation of process and positionality being institutionalized, we
		will constantly be at risk of people (albeit often non-maliciously) unethically creating data visualizations to 
		prove their beliefs rather than learn new ones.
